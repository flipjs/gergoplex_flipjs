/* Welcome to ASETNIOP
 *
 * This file contains your personal chords, the  basic layout, symbols and 
 * layers are in different files. Refer to dicts.def for their locations!
 *
 * This is a very different layout based off this table
 * http://asetniop.com/ 
 *
 * Unlike standard Asetniop there are a few concessions that must be
 * made. Namely we don't do partials and if a chord has multiple left/
 * right words we go with the most common of the two.
 *
 * Also note, All Combos _must_ be done through Command Mode! If you
 * use a combo enough add it to your dictionary in the USR section!
 *
 * Two 'layers' are available, CMD and USR. Just add these into a chord. 
 * You'll enter/exit these layers with SET_STICKY(CMD) and SET_STICKY(0)
 *
 * Note: The engine optimizes for the longest chord it can find, every
 * now and again this makes conflicts! If you have a better dictionary
 * or come up with improvements, please submit a PR!
