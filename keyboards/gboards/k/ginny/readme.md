# Ginny!

![Ginny](https://assets.bigcartel.com/product_images/247416878/IMG_20191025_1424438-01.jpeg)

Quite possibly the smallest, most feature-filled board you can fit in your pocket.

With multi-language onboard ASETNIOP and all sorts of fun shenanigans.
da, de, en, en-colemak, en-dvorak, es, fn, fr, hu, it, nl, nw, pl, pt, ro, sv, tr
More lanugages more fun, look at dicts.def for the language config :)

This board is more than a novelty, it's an ergonomic wonder!
